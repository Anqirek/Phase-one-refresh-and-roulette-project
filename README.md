# Phase-one-refresh-and-roulette-project

Hey Everyone, 

Welcome to our web application, Refresh and Roulette!

To get started, run the local JSON server. If you're not familiar with how to perform this task,

do not worry, we have you covered! We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create this project. 

We wanted to make a fun game so users can enjoy themselves.

Here's how you can start the JSON server:

1. Open up terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows...yuck).
2. Browse to the directory of the db.json file in the terminals.
3. Type in the following command: json-server --watch db.json
4. You should see something like the following below, in your terminal.

5. Browse to the index.html file and open the file in a browser.

    Our Application is a simple interactive Trivia game. You click on the "Let's play Trivia" button and boom,
    
   the next screen will load the first question. All questions are true/false boolean questions. There are
   
  There are five randomized questions. If no answer is chosen, you will not be able to proceed, 
  
  so make sure you select an answer. After the last question, your results will be posted, and if you have an 
  
  extra minute, please fill out our feedback form. Let us know how we did! 
  
  Enjoy your stay, and share this with your friends!
  
  Best,
  Refresh & Roulette Team
